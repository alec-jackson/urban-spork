<!--
This file does not work when the project is viewed locally due to cross-origin requests
being blocked. It does work when all files are behind the same domain, like on our site.
This file is included to show how we handled reusing the same portion of code repeatedly
and as an example of how something similar may be done. Be aware that jquery is
necessary for this to work.
